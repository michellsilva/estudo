"""Line oriented renderers for ingest listings, the timeline, and the SVG.

Text renderers produce deterministic, diff friendly output. The SVG renderer
draws the aligned timeline the CLI computed, with a minute axis, real event
labels, and the three sources on separate lanes. Every number in the SVG comes
from the timeline that was actually built from the sample inputs.
